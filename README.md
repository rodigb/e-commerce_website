# How to setup the website on a Linux VM

This README file will go through:

* How to install a Linux VM on Windows
* Downloading the website code from GitHub onto the Linux VM
* Downloading / setting up a local webserver on the Linux VM
* Running the website on the local server
* Shell Script that automatically does it for you (OPTIONAL)

## Installing the Linux VM

to install the VM go to the [VirtualBox Website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), since we are
installing it on windows, click on windows host.

Also be sure to download the Linux OS itself from [Here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms).

Once installed, choose a path. For this virtual machine I would use Ubuntu x64. Choose how much memory
you would like the VM to be able to use according to how much memory your computer could afford to 
allocate.

Click create and go with the default settings.

Once you have created your virtual machine, click on the start button to get it running!
